# Behavioural Planner 
A finite-statemachine based behavioural planner module written in C++. This project was built in collaboration with Rowan Dempster during my 2020 Summer COOP. The exact responsibilities are highlighted in the [Features](#Features) section.

The behaviour planner system plans the set of high level driving actions/maneuvers, to safely achieve the driving mission under vaiours driving situations. Behaviour planner considers the rules of the road, static, and dynamic objects around the vehicle. The behavioural planner is part of the hierachical framework for an autonomous vehicle. For more information, on behavioural planner, I recommend checkingout [this research paper](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2014/6/IV2014-Junqing-Final.pdf)  by Junqing Wei.
